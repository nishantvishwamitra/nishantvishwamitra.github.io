I am an assistant professor in the [Department of Information Systems and Cyber Security](https://business.utsa.edu/information-systems-cyber-security/) at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA). My research is focused on studying current and emerging cybersecurity issues in online hate and offensiveness, security of AI/ML systems, and online privacy.

I received my Ph.D in CSE from the Unversity at Buffalo, SUNY in spring 2022, under the direction of [Dr. Hongxin Hu](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~hongxinh/). I have worked on various aspects of emerging cybersecurity threats such as cyberbullying, cyberharassment, online offensiveness, attacks and defenses of AI/ML models, and image privacy and security.

I am actively looking for self-motivated students (PhD/Master/Undergraduate/Intern) to conduct research in online hate and offensiveness, AI/ML security (adversarial attacks, robustness, interpretability/explainability, privacy, and backdoors), crowdsourcing, and social media mining. Interested students please feel free to send me an email with your CV and transcript.
